# R_intro_course_turku_finland_2022
The file "kompendium" includes all the practice and exercises I tackled during an introductory R course. 
The file "kompendium_onlyexercises" specifically contains the final exercises I solved individually to complete the requirements of the course.

All other files are unfortunate chaotic mix that I hope to go through someday and sort out. 
(Half of the files are datasets used to created the other half of the files.)
If one goes step by step through kompendium, it makes sense though, I swear.
